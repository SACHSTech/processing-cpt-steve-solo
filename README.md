# The Trivia Quiz Game

The Trivia Quiz Game is designed to challenge players' knowledge across various topics, including History, Geography, Pop Culture, and miscellaneous questions. The objective of the game is to answer multiple-choice questions correctly within a set time limit to achieve the highest score possible. The game starts on an opening page where players can begin the game. Players then proceed to the topic selection page, where they choose from History, Geography, Pop Culture, or Mixed questions. Following the topic selection, players choose a time limit for answering each question: 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or no time limit. On the question page, players are presented with questions and multiple-choice options. They select an answer by clicking on the appropriate option. If the time limit is passed, the program moves on to the next question and no points are added. At the end, players' scores tallied are displayed at the end of the game. The final page shows the score as a percentage of correct answers out of the total questions answered, and players can choose to play again or quit the game. Upon each new iteration of the game, the questions will be in a randomized order that 

Each correct answer earns one point, contributing to the final score presented as a percentage out of the total questions. Despite the program's simple objectives, the game has some limitations. It currently includes only a fixed number of questions per topic, meaning there are no new questions that are added during gameplay. Players will encounter the same questions, which can get repetitive and hinders the game's replayability. Additionally, the game does not save or track high scores across different sessions, limiting its replayability for those seeking to improve or compete over time.

The Trivia Quiz Game contains visuals from various background images that enhance the user experience. The opening page, topic selection page, timer selection page, question page, and final score page each have specific visuals to guide players through the game. Screenshots of these pages, such as the Opening Page, Mode Page, Difficulty Page, Questions Page, and Ending Page, are below. This game is an enjoyable way to test and expand your knowledge across different subjects, challenging you to see how well you can perform under pressure.
